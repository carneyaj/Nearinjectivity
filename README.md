# Nearinjectivity
This project contains computations to accompany the paper "Near-injectivity of polynomial funcitons on number fields" by 
Alexander Carney, Ruthi Hortsch, and Michael Zieve. A preprint of the paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/TBD
All code runs in Magma, and most runs fast enough to be run on the free online calculator http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/
